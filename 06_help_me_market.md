Bring out your inner Shaan Puri energy and put on the marketer hat because you need to help me make Cora shine and get that juicy revenue growth!

We want to talk about:

$ARGUMENTS

If you want, you can:

- Dig into the codebase (especially the commits around timeframe relevant to this request) to understand the actual changes we made and get to the source truth. Always read all relevant commits, not just their messages to actually understand how / if this impacts the end user because some commits may be internal facing or building towards a feature we haven't yet released. We only wanna talk about the actual user facing changes.

- Study the docs/developer-docs/ directory for a quick reference of the core pillars of our application

- Think hard and suggest 3 potential alternatives, along with the mental model you took for each.

Suggest a few relevant screenshots to make the message stronger by adding "<SCREENSHOT>what to show here</SCREENSHOT>" tags in the post.
